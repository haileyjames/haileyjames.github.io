<!-- I'm a first-year PhD Student at UC San Diego advised by Berk Ustun. I earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Harvard, where I worked with Professors Jim Waldo and Stuart Shieber, and Dr. David Alvarez-Melis (Microsoft Research). After graduation I worked as a Machine Learning Research Engineer, first at Lendbuzz, a startup dedicated to increasing access to financial services, and then at Twitter Cortex. My research interests include human-centered machine learning, participatory design, fairness, and interpretabilty. My non-academic interests include cycling, cooking, climbing, squash and percussion instruments.
