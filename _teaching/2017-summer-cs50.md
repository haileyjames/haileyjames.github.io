[CS50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CS50 "CS50") is Harvard's introductory computer science course. I spent the summer of 2017 working with the teaching staff to develop new curriculum and teaching materials for CS50. I also worked on an interview project aimed at increasing diversity in CS at Harvard.
