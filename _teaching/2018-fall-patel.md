The Patel Fellowship is a university-wide financial award to support equity and inclusion efforts in CS education. I used the fellowship to serve as a specialized teaching fellow for Professor Stuart Shieber, working with struggling students and developing pedagogy to support students of diverse backgrounds. My efforts included teaching functional programming to students in individual and small-group sessions 5-7 days per week, coordinating with teaching staff to ensure equity and inclusion, and using new data management practices to track student progress and validate pedagogical choices.
