[AddisCoder](https://www.addiscoder.com/ "Addiscoder") is a program created by professor Jelani Nelson to increase access to computer science and offer mentorship to high school students in Ethiopia. With the other teaching staff, I created curriculum, gave lectures, and worked individually with students in summer computer science course for 180 Ethiopian high school students. Following their participation in the program, several students have now been accepted to top universities in computer science.
